1-ng build --configuration production

2- Copy the dist Folder to the Server:
#Use scp or any other method to transfer the dist folder to your Ubuntu server. For example:
scp -r ./dist/your-project-name user@your-server-ip:/path/to/target/directory
************************http-server*********************************************************************************
3-Install a Web Server (if not already installed):  lightweight HTTP server such as http-server which can be easily installed using Node.js
   sudo npm install -g http-server
4-Navigate to the directory containing your dist folder on the server and start the http-server
  cd /path/to/target/directory/your-project-name
  http-server -p 8080
5-Access Your Application:
  http://your-server-ip:8080
		
6-To run the http-server continuously, you might want to use a process manager like pm2:
 6-1-Install pm2:
   sudo npm install -g pm2
 
 6-2-Start http-server with pm2
   pm2 start $(which http-server) -- -p 8080
   
 6-3-Save the pm2 Process List and Enable Startup Script:
  pm2 save
  pm2 startup

This will ensure that your http-server starts automatically on system reboots.

3-Install a Web Server (if not already installed):  nginx

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nginx
  
4-Configure Nginx:
 Nginx configured to serve your Angular application. Open the Nginx configuration file for editing:

  sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
  
Replace the contents with the following configuration, adjusting the root directive to the path where your dist folder is located:
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-server-domain-or-IP;

    location / {
        root /path/to/your/dist/folder;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}

5-Test the Nginx Configuration:
  sudo nginx -t
6-Restart Nginx:
 sudo systemctl restart nginx
 
7-Access Your Application:
      you should be able to access your Angular application by navigating to your server's domain or IP address in a web browser.
